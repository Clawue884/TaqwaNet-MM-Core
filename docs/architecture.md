# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The TaqwaNet Muamalah Matrix (TaqwaNet-MM-Core) is designed with a modular architecture that promotes scalability, maintainability, and security. The architecture is based on microservices principles, allowing different components to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## High-Level Architecture

The system consists of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: A web-based user interface that interacts with the backend services via RESTful APIs.
2. **Backend Services**: Microservices that handle business logic, data processing, and communication with external systems.
3. **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user data, transactions, and other relevant information.
4. **Blockchain Layer**: Integration with a blockchain network for secure and transparent transaction processing.
5. **AI Engine**: Machine learning models for fraud detection, market analysis, and personalized recommendations.
6. **Security Layer**: Advanced security features including encryption, biometric authentication, and intrusion detection.
